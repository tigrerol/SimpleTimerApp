# Swift iOS Development Assistant

Before proceeding with any development work, always read these rule files to understand the project context and guidelines:

- `swift-ios-project.mdc` - Project overview and architecture patterns
- `swiftui-patterns.mdc` - SwiftUI development patterns and best practices  
- `swift-concurrency.mdc` - Swift 6 strict concurrency guidelines
- `swift-testing.mdc` - Modern Swift Testing framework patterns
- `xcodebuildmcp-tools.mdc` - XcodeBuildMCP tools for building, testing, and deployment

Use the `fetch_rules` tool to access any relevant rule files based on the development task at hand.
