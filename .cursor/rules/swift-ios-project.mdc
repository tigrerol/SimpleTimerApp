# Project-wide AI coding guidelines for Cursor (Swift iOS app)

## Project Overview

This is a native **iOS application** built with **Swift 6.1+** and **SwiftUI**. The codebase targets **iOS 18.0 and later**, allowing full use of the latest Swift and iOS APIs without backward compatibility concerns. All concurrency is handled with **Swift Concurrency** (async/await, actors, @MainActor isolation) ensuring thread-safe code.

- **Frameworks & Tech:** SwiftUI for UI, Swift Concurrency with strict mode, Swift Package Manager for modular architecture
- **Architecture:** Model-View (MV) pattern using pure SwiftUI state management. We avoid MVVM and instead leverage SwiftUI's built-in state mechanisms (@State, @Observable, @Environment, @Binding)
- **Testing:** Swift Testing framework with modern @Test macros and #expect/#require assertions
- **Platform:** iOS (Simulator and Device)
- **Accessibility:** Full accessibility support using SwiftUI's accessibility modifiers

## Project Structure

The project follows a **workspace + SPM package** architecture:

```
YourApp/
├── Config/                         # XCConfig build settings
│   ├── Debug.xcconfig
│   ├── Release.xcconfig
│   ├── Shared.xcconfig
│   └── Tests.xcconfig
├── YourApp.xcworkspace/            # Workspace container
├── YourApp.xcodeproj/              # App shell (minimal wrapper)
├── YourApp/                        # App target - just the entry point
│   ├── Assets.xcassets/
│   ├── YourAppApp.swift           # @main entry point only
│   └── YourApp.xctestplan
├── YourAppPackage/                 # All features and business logic
│   ├── Package.swift
│   ├── Sources/
│   │   └── YourAppFeature/        # Feature modules
│   └── Tests/
│       └── YourAppFeatureTests/   # Swift Testing tests
└── YourAppUITests/                 # UI automation tests
```

**Important:** All development work should be done in the **YourAppPackage** Swift Package, not in the app project. The app project is merely a thin wrapper that imports and launches the package features.

# Code Quality & Style Guidelines

## Swift Style & Conventions

- **Naming:** Use `UpperCamelCase` for types, `lowerCamelCase` for properties/functions. Choose descriptive names (e.g., `calculateMonthlyRevenue()` not `calcRev`)
- **Value Types:** Prefer `struct` for models and data, use `class` only when reference semantics are required
- **Enums:** Leverage Swift's powerful enums with associated values for state representation
- **Early Returns:** Prefer early return pattern over nested conditionals to avoid pyramid of doom

## Optionals & Error Handling

- Use optionals with `if let`/`guard let` for nil handling
- Never force-unwrap (`!`) without absolute certainty - prefer `guard` with failure path
- Use `do/try/catch` for error handling with meaningful error types
- Handle or propagate all errors - no empty catch blocks

## Modern SwiftUI Architecture Guidelines (2025)

### No ViewModels - Use Native SwiftUI Data Flow
**New features MUST follow these patterns:**

1. **Views as Pure State Expressions**
   ```swift
   struct MyView: View {
       @Environment(MyService.self) private var service
       @State private var viewState: ViewState = .loading
       
       enum ViewState {
           case loading
           case loaded(data: [Item])
           case error(String)
       }
       
       var body: some View {
           // View is just a representation of its state
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Use Environment Appropriately**
   - **App-wide services**: Router, Theme, CurrentAccount, Client, etc. - use `@Environment`
   - **Feature-specific services**: Timeline services, single-view logic - use `let` properties with `@Observable`
   - Rule: Environment for cross-app/cross-feature dependencies, let properties for single-feature services
   - Access app-wide via `@Environment(ServiceType.self)`
   - Feature services: `private let myService = MyObservableService()`

3. **Local State Management**
   - Use `@State` for view-specific state
   - Use `enum` for view states (loading, loaded, error)
   - Use `.task(id:)` and `.onChange(of:)` for side effects
   - Pass state between views using `@Binding`

4. **No ViewModels Required**
   - Views should be lightweight and disposable
   - Business logic belongs in services/clients
   - Test services independently, not views
   - Use SwiftUI previews for visual testing

5. **When Views Get Complex**
   - Split into smaller subviews
   - Use compound views that compose smaller views
   - Pass state via bindings between views
   - Never reach for a ViewModel as the solution

## SwiftUI State Management (MV Pattern)

- **@State:** For all state management, including observable model objects
- **@Observable:** Modern macro for making model classes observable (replaces ObservableObject)
- **@Environment:** For dependency injection and shared app state
- **@Binding:** For two-way data flow between parent and child views
- **@Bindable:** For creating bindings to @Observable objects
- Avoid ViewModels - put view logic directly in SwiftUI views using these state mechanisms
- Keep views focused and extract reusable components

Example with @Observable:
```swift
@Observable
class UserSettings {
    var theme: Theme = .light
    var fontSize: Double = 16.0
}

@MainActor
struct SettingsView: View {
    @State private var settings = UserSettings()
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // Direct property access, no $ prefix needed
            Text("Font Size: \(settings.fontSize)")
            
            // For bindings, use @Bindable
            @Bindable var settings = settings
            Slider(value: $settings.fontSize, in: 10...30)
        }
    }
}

// Sharing state across views
@MainActor
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var userSettings = UserSettings()
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            MainView()
                .environment(userSettings)
        }
    }
}

@MainActor
struct MainView: View {
    @Environment(UserSettings.self) private var settings
    
    var body: some View {
        Text("Current theme: \(settings.theme)")
    }
}
```

Example with .task modifier for async operations:
```swift
@Observable
class DataModel {
    var items: [Item] = []
    var isLoading = false
    
    func loadData() async throws {
        isLoading = true
        defer { isLoading = false }
        
        // Simulated network call
        try await Task.sleep(for: .seconds(1))
        items = try await fetchItems()
    }
}

@MainActor
struct ItemListView: View {
    @State private var model = DataModel()
    
    var body: some View {
        List(model.items) { item in
            Text(item.name)
        }
        .overlay {
            if model.isLoading {
                ProgressView()
            }
        }
        .task {
            // This task automatically cancels when view disappears
            do {
                try await model.loadData()
            } catch {
                // Handle error
            }
        }
        .refreshable {
            // Pull to refresh also uses async/await
            try? await model.loadData()
        }
    }
}
```

## Concurrency

- **@MainActor:** All UI updates must use @MainActor isolation
- **Actors:** Use actors for expensive operations like disk I/O, network calls, or heavy computation
- **async/await:** Always prefer async functions over completion handlers
- **Task:** Use structured concurrency with proper task cancellation
- **.task modifier:** Always use .task { } on views for async operations tied to view lifecycle - it automatically handles cancellation
- **Avoid Task { } in onAppear:** This doesn't cancel automatically and can cause memory leaks or crashes
- **Sendable:** Ensure types shared across concurrency domains conform to Sendable
- No GCD usage - Swift Concurrency only

## Code Organization

- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Break large functions (>50 lines) into smaller, testable units
- Use extensions to organize code by feature or protocol conformance
- Prefer `let` over `var` - use immutability by default
- Use `[weak self]` in closures to prevent retain cycles
- Always include `self.` when referring to instance properties in closures

# Development Workflow

1. **Make changes in the Package**: All feature development happens in YourAppPackage/Sources/
2. **Write tests**: Add Swift Testing tests in YourAppPackage/Tests/
3. **Build and test**: Use XcodeBuildMCP tools to build and run tests
4. **Run on simulator**: Deploy to simulator for manual testing
5. **UI automation**: Use describe_ui and automation tools for UI testing
6. **Device testing**: Deploy to physical device when needed

# Best Practices

## SwiftUI & State Management

- Keep views small and focused
- Extract reusable components into their own files
- Use @ViewBuilder for conditional view composition
- Leverage SwiftUI's built-in animations and transitions
- Avoid massive body computations - break them down
- **Always use .task modifier** for async work tied to view lifecycle - it automatically cancels when the view disappears
- Never use Task { } in onAppear - use .task instead for proper lifecycle management

## Performance

- Use .id() modifier sparingly as it forces view recreation
- Implement Equatable on models to optimize SwiftUI diffing
- Use LazyVStack/LazyHStack for large lists
- Profile with Instruments when needed
- @Observable tracks only accessed properties, improving performance over @Published

## Accessibility

- Always provide accessibilityLabel for interactive elements
- Use accessibilityIdentifier for UI testing
- Implement accessibilityHint where actions aren't obvious
- Test with VoiceOver enabled
- Support Dynamic Type

## Security & Privacy

- Never log sensitive information
- Use Keychain for credential storage
- All network calls must use HTTPS
- Request minimal permissions
- Follow App Store privacy guidelines

## Data Persistence

When data persistence is required, always prefer **SwiftData** over CoreData. However, carefully consider whether persistence is truly necessary - many apps can function well with in-memory state that loads on launch.

### When to Use SwiftData

- You have complex relational data that needs to persist across app launches
- You need advanced querying capabilities with predicates and sorting
- You're building a data-heavy app (note-taking, inventory, task management)
- You need CloudKit sync with minimal configuration

### When NOT to Use Data Persistence

- Simple user preferences (use UserDefaults)
- Temporary state that can be reloaded from network
- Small configuration data (consider JSON files or plist)
- Apps that primarily display remote data

### SwiftData Best Practices

```swift
import SwiftData

@Model
final class Task {
    var title: String
    var isCompleted: Bool
    var createdAt: Date
    
    init(title: String) {
        self.title = title
        self.isCompleted = false
        self.createdAt = Date()
    }
}

// In your app
@main
struct MyProjectApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .modelContainer(for: Task.self)
        }
    }
}

// In your views
struct TaskListView: View {
    @Query private var tasks: [Task]
    @Environment(\.modelContext) private var context
    
    var body: some View {
        List(tasks) { task in
            Text(task.title)
        }
        .toolbar {
            Button("Add") {
                let newTask = Task(title: "New Task")
                context.insert(newTask)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Important:** Never use CoreData for new projects. SwiftData provides a modern, type-safe API that's easier to work with and integrates seamlessly with SwiftUI.
